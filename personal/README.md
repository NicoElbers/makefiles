# My personal make file
This is a Makefile I made myself. It is based on [this](https://github.com/TheNetAdmin/Makefile-Templates/blob/master/SmallProject/Template/Makefile) Makefile and then heavily modified for my own use.

## Features
My make file has a number of features:
- Creating the file structure needed for this Makefile `make dir`
- Creating the main binary`make main`
    - Uses all the \*.c\* files in src/ 
    - Stored in bin/
- Creating the test binary `make test` 
    - Uses all the \*.c\* files in src/ **excluding the file in `$(MAIN_FILE)`**
    - Uses all the \*.c\* files in test/
    - Stored in bin/
- Creating a debug binary `make debug`
    - Uses all the \*.c\* files in src/ 
    - Stored in dbg/
- Save the current version of the binary in save/ `make save`
    - Uses the binary made by make main and copies it into save/
    - These binaries will **not** be removed by `make clean`
    - Won't override other binaries by appending the amount of files in save/ to the end of the binary name
        - **BE WARY** this is _not_ a fool proof system. Deleting a file or adding numbers after binaries yourself can break this system
- Clean all created files `make clean`
    - Removes the files made by the Makefile:
        - All files in bin/ created by this makefile
        - All files in obj/ created by this makefile

By default running `make` will run `make dir main test`

## File Structure
The file structure of the Makefile is very simple. This is a basic project, all files in src/ and test/ have been created by the user. All other files were generated by running `make` once and `make save` twice:
```
